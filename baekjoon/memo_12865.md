# commit 07741b96c1f54c0d41f828a1f4c8f7605c301772
I approached the problem in a completely wrong way. I allowed including the same item multiple times when I shouldn't have. I think this happened because I focused too much on what technique I can use for this problem instead of reading the conditions in the problem more carefully.
